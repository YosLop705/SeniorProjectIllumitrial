I made an expansive maze-like platformer game that's multiplayer, it has a scoring system, 3 levels, music both music which I coded to change, sprites and character designs almost entirely of my own, two bosses(dubbed the splinter siblings), the option to play solo, proper animations, a combat system(although its a little bit simple)
